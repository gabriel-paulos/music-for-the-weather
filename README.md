# City-Mood
A node js program that uses the Spotify and OpenweatherMap APIs to relate the current weather in a city to a song on Spotify. 

The program sends a message to your phone about a random city using Twilio's API for SMS messages.

TO BE ADDED: Connect with Twitter and automatically send a tweet that shows the mood in a specific city, along with a link to the chosen song.
